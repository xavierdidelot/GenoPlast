# GenoPlast

## Introduction

Gain and loss of genetic material are essential forces in
bacterial microevolution. They have been repeatedly linked with
adaptation of lineages to new lifestyles, and in particular
pathogenicity. GenoPlast implements a model-based method for using whole
genome sequences to infer the patterns of genome content evolution. The
method is described in
<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2008/11/17/gr.082263.108.abstract">Didelot,
Darling and Falush (2009)</a>. A fundamental property of our model is
that it allows the rates at which genetic elements are gained or lost to
vary in time and from one lineage to another.
